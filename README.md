# Dijkstras-algorithm
Implementing  Dijkstras algorithm

## Project Description
On running this script a Dijkstra’s algorithm will be implemented which shall accept two words – a start vertex and a goal vertex. The search shall traverse your graph to compute the shortest route between the two words, and output the route in terms of the words traversed. In addition, it shall generate an integer score for each Sonnet in which the traversed words feature, incrementing the score by each appearance, and output the number
of the highest scoring Sonnet.

## Languages
Pyhton3.

## Frameworks
Unittest.
